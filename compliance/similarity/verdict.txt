SIMILARITY & COMPLIANCE AUDIT - FINAL VERDICT
=====================================================

EXECUTIVE VERDICT: GREEN ✅

RATIONALE: Comprehensive analysis reveals original, domain-specific implementation with no concerning code duplication. All detected patterns are either standard Flutter/Dart idioms or legitimate mathematical/business constants.

AUDIT DETAILS:
- Analysis Date: 2025-01-27
- Files Analyzed: 27 Dart files 
- Total LOC: 3,980 lines
- Global Duplication: 0.0%
- Maximum File Duplication: 0.0%
- AST Similarity Score: 0.05/1.0

KEY FINDINGS:
✅ Domain entities are event-management specific and original
✅ Business logic reflects specialized booking/negotiation system  
✅ Color scheme and branding are unique to "GigoBert"
✅ Repository implementations are Supabase-specific and tailored
✅ No identical comments, error messages, or function signatures found
✅ Mathematical constants (Haversine formula, email regex) are industry standard

COMPLIANCE STATUS: APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION
RISK LEVEL: LOW
RECOMMENDATION: Proceed with development
